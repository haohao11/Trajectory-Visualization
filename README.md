# Trajectory-Visualization
This project aims at visualizing observed and predicted trajectories with animation

## Observed Trajectories and Predicted Trajectories
In the shared shapes, pedestrian, cyclist, and car trajectories are observed for 6 timesteps. Each timestep lasts 0.5s and in total the observation is 3s. The observation is used to predict trajectories in the next 6 timesteps in 3s. To vividly illustrate the prediction process, including mornitoring potential collisions and deviations and modeling interactions between different transportation modes, animation is used to compare and visualize predicted trajectories with true trajectories.
